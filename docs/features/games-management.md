## API Endpoints

### Games Controller
```
POST   /api/games              # Create new game
GET    /api/games              # Get all games (with filtering)
GET    /api/games/{id}         # Get specific game
PUT    /api/games/{id}         # Update game
DELETE /api/games/{id}         # Delete game
GET    /api/games/search       # Search games
```

### Query Parameters
- `type`: Filter by game type
- `style`: Filter by improv style
- `minPlayers`: Minimum player count
- `maxPlayers`: Maximum player count
- `tags`: Filter by tags
- `search`: Text search in title/description

## Data Model

### Game Entity
```csharp
public class Game
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public string Rules { get; set; }
    public string ExampleDialogue { get; set; }
    public GameType Type { get; set; }
    public ImprovStyle Style { get; set; }
    public PlayerCount PlayerCount { get; set; }
    public List<string> Tags { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime UpdatedAt { get; set; }
}
```
