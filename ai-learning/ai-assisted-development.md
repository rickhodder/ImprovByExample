# AI-Assisted Development Process

## Current AI Tools Used
- GitHub Copilot (Primary coding assistant)
- Claude Sonnet 4 (Architecture and planning)

## My Learning Journey

### Technology Comfort Levels (Starting Point)
- Git: 5/10
- EF Core: 3/10
- ASP.NET Core Razor Pages: 6/10
- PostgreSQL: 1/10
- ASP.NET Core Web API: 6/10
- Docker: 2/10
- Redis: 1/10
- Fast Endpoints: 2/10
- Clean Architecture: 2/10
- MCP: 6/10
- ITextSharp: 3/10
- AWS: 3/10
- AWS ECS: 1/10

## Effective Prompt Strategies

### Architecture Discussions
- Start with context about comfort levels with technologies
- Ask for specific folder structures and implementations
- Request PRDs and feature breakdowns
- Include business requirements and constraints

### Code Generation
- Provide existing code context
- Specify file paths and integration points
- Ask for best practices and patterns
- Request explanations alongside code

### Learning Support
- Request explanations of complex concepts
- Ask for comparative analysis of approaches
- Seek guidance on technology choices
- Ask for step-by-step implementation guidance

## Key Learnings
- Clean Architecture provides clear separation of concerns
- Feature-based organization improves maintainability
- Docker containers simplify development environment setup
- PRDs help structure development phases
- Documentation during development saves time later

## Challenges Overcome
- Understanding Clean Architecture layers and dependencies
- Setting up complex project structure with proper references
- Planning feature implementation with unfamiliar technologies

## AI Interaction Patterns That Work
1. **Context Setting**: Always provide current comfort level and project context
2. **Specific Requests**: Ask for concrete examples and implementations
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Build on previous conversations
4. **Documentation Focus**: Request explanations for learning
