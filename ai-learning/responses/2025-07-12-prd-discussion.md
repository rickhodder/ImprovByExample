# Documentation and Folder Structure Creation

**Date**: July 12, 2025
**AI Assistant**: GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4)
**Topic**: Creating comprehensive documentation structure

## Context
After establishing the initial project structure, I requested creation of:
- AI learning documentation folder structure
- Comprehensive project documentation
- Development setup guides
- Architecture documentation

## My Request
I wanted to add documentation tracking for my AI-assisted development journey and create professional project documentation including:
- AI prompts and responses organization
- Learning progression tracking
- Architecture documentation
- Development setup guides

## Key Insights from AI Response
1. **Documentation Organization**: Structured approach to documenting AI interactions
2. **Learning Tracking**: Importance of tracking comfort levels and progress
3. **Knowledge Building**: Creating reusable prompt libraries and insights
4. **Professional Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation structure

## Files Created
- ai-learning/README.md
- ai-learning/ai-assisted-development.md
- ai-learning/responses/2025-07-12-initial-setup.md
- docs/architecture/overview.md
- docs/development/setup.md
- docs/features/games-management.md
- README.md

## Next Steps
1. Continue documenting AI interactions in responses folder
2. Create learning notes as technologies are explored
3. Update comfort levels as skills improve
4. Build effective prompt library

## Questions for Future Sessions
- How to implement domain entities effectively?
- Best practices for EF Core configuration?
- Docker development workflow optimization?
- Fast Endpoints setup and configuration?
