# Architecture Discussion Prompts

## Initial Architecture Planning
```
I am a c# developer trying to strengthen my skills and learn new technologies. I want to create a new application from the ground up using best practices. 

Technologies and comfort levels (1-10):
- Git: 5
- EF Core: 3
- ASP.NET Core Web App using Razor pages: 6
- PostgreSQL: 1
- ASP.NET Core Web API: 6
- Docker: 2
- Redis: 1
- Fast Endpoints: 2
- Clean Architecture: 2

The application will be [describe application]. I would like guidance on:
- Project structure and folder organization
- Technology integration approach
- Development phases and priorities
- Best practices for the architecture pattern
```

## Clean Architecture Guidance
```
Can you explain Clean Architecture in the context of my application? I'm particularly interested in:
- How the layers interact
- Dependency flow and injection
- Where to place specific types of code
- How to maintain separation of concerns
```

## Technology Integration
```
How do I integrate [Technology A] with [Technology B] in a Clean Architecture setup? 
- What layer should each technology live in?
- How do I maintain testability?
- What are the configuration best practices?
```

## Feature Planning
```
I want to implement [Feature Name]. Can you help me plan:
- Which Clean Architecture layers are involved?
- What design patterns should I use?
- How to structure the code within the feature folder?
- What testing strategy should I follow?
```

## Best Practices Inquiry
```
What are the best practices for [Specific Technology/Pattern] in the context of:
- Clean Architecture
- Feature-based organization
- .NET 8 applications
- Container deployment
```
